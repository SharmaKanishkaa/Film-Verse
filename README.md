## Project Structure
**Streamlit Application**: A user-friendly application that provides movie recommendations based on content-based similarity.
**Jupyter Notebook**: Contains exploratory data analysis (EDA) and implementations of both collaborative and content-based filtering. This notebook demonstrates the approach taken to build and evaluate the different recommendation models.
**Models and Data**: Precomputed similarity matrices and movie metadata are stored as .pkl files for efficient loading.

## Features
- **Movie Selection**: Choose a movie from a comprehensive list to generate recommendations.
- **Customizable Recommendations**: Select the number of movie recommendations to display.
- **Rating Filter**: Filter movies based on a minimum rating threshold.
- **Movie Details**: View additional details like movie ratings and posters.
- **Interactive UI with Streamlit**: User-friendly and interactive UI for seamless navigation.
- **Content-Based Recommendation**: Uses cosine similarity to recommend movies similar to the selected title.
- **API Integration**: Integrates with The Movie Database (TMDb) API for real-time movie data.
- **Efficient Data Handling**: Uses pickle files for precomputed similarity data, improving response time.
- **Dynamic UI Elements**: Provides toggle options, filter choices, and custom recommendation numbers.
- **Error Handling**: Manages API request errors gracefully to ensure a smooth user experience.
